## Notes

This is a custom build of my fork of containerssh to add a cleanup/teardown webhook, until my PR [#567](https://github.com/ContainerSSH/libcontainerssh/pull/567) is accepted.

Thanks to `go work` weirdness, IDEs may throw a fit and direct go builds may fail, but the docker build should succeed.
